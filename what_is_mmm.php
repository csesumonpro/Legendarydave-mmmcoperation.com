WHAT IS MMM </h1>
<div class="row" style="padding:40px;background:#efefef">
<p style="font-style:italic;">Attention! First be sure to read the <a href="warning.php" style="text-decoration:underline;color:red;">WARNING!</a></p>
&nbsp;
<p>MMM is not a bank, MMM does not collect your MONEY, MMM is not an online business, HYIP, investment or MLM program. MMM is a community where people help each other. MMM gives you a technical basic program, which helps millions of participants worldwide to find those who NEED help, and those who are ready to PROVIDE help for FREE. All transferred BITCOINS to another participants are your help given by your own good will to another one, absolutely gratis. If you are completely confident and certain in your actions and make your mind to participate, we kindly ask you to study carefully all warnings and instructions first. In cases of any matter regarding the topic our online consultants are ready to help and answer all your questions.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 27px;">HOW DOES IT WORK</h1>
<img src="/site/img/how_is_work.jpg"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MMM is a community of people providing each other financial help on the principle of gratuitousness, reciprocity and benevolence. We use BITCOIN infrastructure in our transactions.</p>
<p>In MMM you don&rsquo;t have to make contracts or pledge your property. In MMM there are no lenders and no debtors. Everything is very simple: one participant asks for help &mdash; another one helps.</p>
<p>The only thing that MMM demands from its participants is to be honest and kind to each other. You ask for financial help when you need it, you give financial help when you are able to do it.</p>
<p>In their transactions MMM participants operate with BITCOINS. It is the best possible way to organize smooth transfers between participants from different countries. Like BITCOIN causes revolution in financial relations, so MMM causes revolution in social relations between people. This combination of MMM and BITCOIN ideas of fair and free financial system makes possible for us to establish significant changes in modern world.</p>
<div style="padding:30px 0;font-weight:bold;">
<p>VERY IMPORTANT!</p>
<p>There is no —Åentral account, where all the money flows to (and where it can be easily stolen from :-)). <em>All the money is distributed between the participants themselves! </em> On a lot of thousands and millions accounts. <em>Participants transfer BITCOINS directly to each other, without intermediaries! (What are they for? :-))</em> In fact, MMM only regulates the process and nothing more.</p>
<p>I.e. the System completely belongs to people. Without fools! It is a real mutual aid fund, where ordinary people help each other.</p>
</div>
<p>How does it work technically? You declare the willingness to give help (click in your Personal Office (hereinafter PO) &quot;Provide Help&quot;), after that your account will be credited with Mavro (internal currency of the System). Mavro&#39;s amount will start to grow from the moment of deposit. And the rate of growth can be slowly or rapidly, everything depends on you &amp; your activity only. (Calculation of growth occurs every day at 00:00 GMT.) This sum in Mavro shows how much money you earn from daily job.</p>
<p>We make the participation in MMM COOPERATION more attractive and useful for everybody. We encourage our participant to be involved in development of MMM COOPERATION. Due to these reasons we&rsquo;ve established MMM Extra. This model allows each participant to get earn money from daily job!</p>
<p>This new model itself is database of web-tasks available in your Personal Office and designed to promote MMM COOPERATIONwide. We offer you an opportunity to perform these tasks in your PO and as a reward your Mavro will grow. In your Personal Office you just need to buy special Mavro (Mavro-Extra). After buying these Mavro you have to go to the appropriate section in your PO, which is called MMM Extra. On the Extra&rsquo;s main page you will find the list of current web-tasks. In order to make your Mavro grow, you have to perform these tasks on daily basis and your Mavro will grow on daily basis as well. Together with these tasks you will find all the necessary instructions, recommendations and screenshots. So it will be very easy for everybody to complete any task from the list. But if you do not perform any task from MMM Extra your Mavro will grow slowly, which is still not bad. The conclusion is: if you perform tasks from MMM Extra every day, your Mavro will grow <span id="result_box" lang="en">rapidly</span>; if you don&rsquo;t perform any task, your Mavro will grow slowly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider an example now. Say, you have announced willingness to provide help in amount of $100. You will be credited in your PO with 100 Mavros. And they will immediately start to grow every day! But the rate of growth directly depends on your activity. If you perform tasks every day,  your Mavro will grow rapidly. <span id="result_box" lang="en">And vice versa, your mavro will grow slowly if you don't perform any tasks. </span></p>
<p>However, it is not necessary to wait for a month. Help can be requested at any time. But only after confirmation of your Mavros. What does &quot;after confirmation&quot; mean? It means only after your BITCOIN transfer, when you really provide assistance to another participant. (But not just declare willingness. :-))&nbsp;Order for providing help comes to you in your Personal Office. If you do not complete it within 36 hours, you will be removed from the System!</p>
<p>In cases of any questions regarding the topic your upline or guider are ready to help and answer all your questions.</p>
<p><em>Please note that receives money from MMM can&rsquo;t be considered as a yield (we are the mutual aid fund), and nobody promises or guarantees to pay it! Read over <a href="warning">THE WARNING</a>.</em></p>
