<p style="text-align:right;font-style:italic;">"Everyone knows it's impossible. But once comes an ignorant,<br>
to whom it is unknown — and he makes a discovery."</p>
<p style="text-align:right;font-style:italic;">Albert Einstein</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">For a start watch this video.</p>

<p>Have you watched? Who is it about? About fleas? Or about us? The people who were born in the bank system?<br>
Don't you sometimes think that you were born for greater things? Not for glass jars, not for the dullness and hopelessness that surrounds you today? Not to be forced to work hard from morning till evening for somebody else and get miserable pennies for this hard work?<br>
And spend all your life on this!<br>
The only life you have, because you won’t get another one!!<br>
Never!!!<br>
Did you think of it? If yes, then we have the same way!<br>
We Are Changing The World!<br>
Today you help others — tomorrow you will be helped!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Or not. Here's another thing. A small digression.</p>
<p>First of all. For information. We still live in a slave society. Like we did thousands of years ago. Nothing has changed since then. Except that the chains are economic now. That's the only difference. And for the rest, everything is the same. There are slaves and owners. The owners are the ones who print money. Have you got surprised? :-))</p>
<p>Next. What is money? Nothing! Nihil. A phantom. Emptiness! Just the colorful paper, beautifully decorated with all sorts water marks, emblems and pictures. (Usually the portraits of great men. They look so respectable. :-)) Owners print it in any quantity and when they want to.</p>
<p>Money is nothing more but wrap paper. Owners give it to slaves as "pay for work". Doing it, they teach the slaves solemnly that "money must be earned honestly." And the slaves obediently listen to them. We are brainwashed from the cradle with all sorts of books, pamphlets, films, mass media — this whole giant, well-organized and ruthlessly efficient state brainwashing machine. The slaves do not know other things, and they think that the world should work like this and they have no other ways. But, they do!!</p>
<p>Together we change the world!</p>
<p>P.S. One more thing. In fact, people don’t need much money. That is not money which is important. It is important that you are AWARE of having it! You know there's a money box, which you can open at any time and take out as much money as you need. That's what is really important! Confidence in the future. Reliability.</p>
<p>Now MMM is such a money box. One common box. For everybody. The money box, where millions of people keep their funds. Do you need money? Open and take it. As much as you need. That’s it. A sort of global mutual aid fund. Today you have helped — tomorrow you will be helped! This is the point of the System. Read <a href="./" target="_blank">IDEOLOGY</a>. Before you join. This is very important!</p>
